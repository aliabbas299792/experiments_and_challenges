# CSES Solutions
The Makefile makes it easier to do stuff:
```bash
make all # make all binaries
make clean # clean up all object files and binaries
make new x y # make a new problem subfolder for problem number x with name y, it'll make a main.cpp inside
make run x # runs the solution for problem x
make lldb x # allows debugging the binary for problem x
make list # list all problems
```
